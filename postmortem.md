# Approach and Process
## What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
  - go look at other people's project, get inspiration. there is something you can learn from everyone.

## What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
  - if after trying, cannot get it. Just ask someone who can help.
  - plan and think first before coding, break it into smaller problems.
    e.g. how to generate a random string, how to shuffle my string, how can i check? break up the different checks into different functions.

# Code and Code Design
## What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
  - organisation of my code;
  - gets too messy at the end, especially screens and timers.
  - split out the css and javascript files maybe? how should i structure it game logic? interface stuff etc.
  - too many global values, hard to keep track
## What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
  - coding a smaller version in codepen before adding it into the main code.
  - tried to split the "displaying" functions from the "logic" functions.

# WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem
## What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
  - committing regularly, builds confidence
  - pseudo code
  - googling
  - codepen-ing something out to try
## What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
  - debugging skills. because never carefully look line by line.
    spent a lot of time debugging inputBox.innerHTML.value = "". should have been inputBox.value = "".
## How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
  - very fun.
  - the starting exercises ramps up in difficulty too quickly. sample code to let us learn from it will help a lot.
  - I don't have time to catch up on the syntax and stuff not covered in class. So when other people use it, I don't understand.

debugging takes patience
practice makes it better
sharing and discussing code helps
